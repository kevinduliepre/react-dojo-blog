# React Dojo Blog - Version 2.0

I worked on the integration of [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) in the version 2.0 of this project and I am quite so happy to see how I learn how to.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm json-server --watch data/json.db --port 8000`

I run json-server on port 8000 because port 3000 is already busy running the project. You can choose another port but don't forget to specify the port number.'
